# Conway-s-Game-Of-Life

Just my take on Conway's Game of life, used some OOP concepts to solve this problem.


# The Rules
## For a space that is 'populated':\n
  *Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.\n
  *Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n
  *Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.\n
  *For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'\n
  *Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.\n
