# Conway-s-Game-Of-Life

The game involves an (infinite) two-dimensional grid with black and white squares, which may be represented as 1 and 0. One may think of them as "live cells" or "dead cells".

# The Rules
## For a space that is 'populated':
  * Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
  * Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
  * Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
  * For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
  * Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
